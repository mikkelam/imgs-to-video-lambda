Simple program to turn a sequence of images into a video, given a list of urls of the images

This was written for usage in AWS lambda. In my case to turn a set of presigned S3 image urls into a video and upload it.

One cool thing about this piece, is that images are downloaded and muxed into the video with a streaming pattern. Currently it will maximally keep 100 images in memory at a time. This works nicely with lambda as they have memory bounds and memory based pricing. This result is accomplished by a producer/consumer pattern using python's excellent asyncio ‚ù§Ô∏è
